# KQB Scoreboard
KQB Scoreboard is a simple scoreboard based off of AJAX calls. The scoreboard is meant to be used as a broadcast asset for community members to stream games and keep track of score.

This is a fan-made project and is not associated with Killer Queen Black and its related subsidiaries.

## Installation
It works as-is! Clone the repository, add a browser source in OBS/Xsplit/Vmix with scoreboard.html and control how it shows up using StreamControl (controller/StreamControl.exe).

You can also download the repository under [Releases](https://github.com/vphandango/kqb-scoreboard/releases).

## How to Use
Open up StreamControl.exe and change the team names, current maps, and scores. Click the save icon on the top left of the program (CTRL+S also saves when StreamControl is the active window). To show/hide the scoreboard, click on the "Toggle Scoreboard" button.

## Troubleshoot
* **I don't see the scoreboard at all!**  
Be sure that you toggle the scoreboard in StreamControl so it shows up.

* **I don't like how it looks!**
